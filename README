# Offline Harassment Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements an **AI-based Offline Harassment Detection System** that works without internet access. The system integrates both **audio** and **video** models to detect violent or harassment-related activities in real-time.  

It leverages:  
- 🎥 **Video-based violence detection** using the **Real-Life Violence Situations dataset (RLVS)**  
- 🎙️ **Audio-based harassment detection** using the **RAVDESS Emotional Speech dataset**  
- 🧠 Deep learning models built with **Keras/TensorFlow**  
- 🖥️ A user-friendly **Streamlit interface** for offline use  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Dual-Modality Detection** → Combines audio + video analysis for higher accuracy.  
- **Offline Functionality** → Works without internet connectivity.  
- **Streamlit UI** → Simple and interactive interface.  
- **Modular Codebase** → Separated utilities, models, and UI for scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Datasets**:  
  - RLVS (Violence/Non-Violence video dataset)  
  - RAVDESS (Emotional speech dataset for audio classification)

## 📊 Datasets

- **Video Dataset:** [Real-Life Violence Situations (RLVS)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset) — contains approximately 2,000 video clips, evenly split between violent and non-violent situations, collected from real-life scenarios :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- **Audio Dataset:** [RAVDESS Emotional Speech Audio](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio) — high-quality emotional speech recordings covering emotions like calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, and disgusted at two intensity levels :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=1}.
